                I was lost now I'm found <br>
                I'm sustained by the sound <br>
                Of the angels singing me to sleep <br>
                While my feet are leaving the ground <br>
                Am I dead? Or am I dreaming instead? <br>
                A cornucopia of opiates have flooded my head

                I'm insane, I am smart <br>
                All it takes, is a spark, to ignite my bad intentions <br>
                And do what I do best to your heart <br>
                Don't be fooled I was raised by the wolves <br>
                Now the moon hangs in full, so you know I won't play by the rules

                I will never spill <br>
                (Spill my blood for you) <br>
                You have let me down <br>
                (One too many times) <br>
                Someway somehow, we've fallen out <br>
                Caught in between my enemies <br>
                No way not now, I won't back down <br>
                I draw the line at you and me <br>
                Your what I started, now disregarded <br>
                One day they'll see, it was always me

                Due to mistakes, I have made to the state <br>
                I am trapped inside a dillinger <br>
                Diligently thinking of ways to get out of this God awful place <br>
                I have learned that my fate is something I can't escape so <br>
                Sound the alarm, what I've said from the start <br>
                Is ill never let your system break me down or tear me apart <br>
                Don't be fooled I was raised by the wolves <br>
                Now the moon hangs in full so you know I won't
                Play by the rules!
